# Object Detection Project

This project is adapted from [sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Object-Detection](https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Object-Detection). It is intended to be a learning experience for myself to help with my computer vision research.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the VOC2007 test and train datasets, as well as the VOC2012 train dataset.

## Features

- Modified VGG16 network: The project includes a modified VGG16 network architecture for object detection.

- Real-time object detection: The program supports real-time object detection using the default webcam of the device.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
